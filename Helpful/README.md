    Objective- Effective Code Writing and Execution

1. Synopsis
    1. The purpose of this document is to establish a "SOP" (Standard Operating Procedure) for creating and modifying code.
    1. The standards outlined here are to establish effective, efficient, common, readable, trackable, and accountable code-writing methodologies so that all code written by any member can be read, understood, and explained by any other member.
    1. The content here is not only to establish the SOP, but, also to create and/or follow known Best Practices, including but not limited to, PEP8 (see Resources).
    1. The reason for creating the SOP is to standardize all code written so that it can be efficiently read, understood, modified, and communicated without the need for either excessive time spent deciphering, or re-writing a new code ('re-inventing the wheel').
